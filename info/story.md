Robots keep little mechbirds as pets.
Recently, they was trying to teach it how to speak basic language.
Today the bird spoke its first word: "hieeelalaooo".
This sounds a lot like "hello", but with too many vowels.
With the information they discovered, we should help them to make a translation module.
